    <div class="col-12 bg-info rounded font-weight-bold" style="border-radius:5px">Event management has burst on the academic and applied fields in the last 30 years as an independent entity, although the event product has existed for approximately as long as mankind has existed. Certainly, from recorded time, events have taken a major role in history as part of celebration, religion, community, and even revolution events that have been focal points of importance to residents, regions, and nations. Therefore, the direction of the present paper is to review what is happening in event management today and suggest the future direction that event management will likely take over the next 30 years. The main conclusion from the paper is that event management is getting stronger as an academic field as well as a major element of tourism development. Which suggests that the future should be bright for both academics and professionals in event management in the years to come.</div>
